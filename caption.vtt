00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.850
Welcome to the course on creating reliefs in Carveco or ArtCAM 2018.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.150
This is the introductory lesson.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:16.170
I will talk a little more about what you need understand to start this course and, of course, some basic

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.970
things that we will use.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:26.650
The creation of reliefs in ArtCAM, Carveco or any other CAM program with this functionality is initially

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.270
done through the creation of vectors.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:34.770
The creation and editing vectors are essential for creating reliefs in ArtCAM.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:42.780
If you don't have experience in creating vectors directly on ArtCAM, but you do have experience in Corel Draw,

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.610
Illustrattor, or any other vector creation software, that will be sufficient.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:57.460
Throughout the course, I chose to use only one software which is Carveco, to also demonstrate vector

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.360
editing if necessary when creating the reliefs.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.490
Well, let 's get to know our workspace.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:11.410
Alright folks, this is our workspace and as you can see there are a lot of tools here for us to work with.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:18.460
The vector creation tools are located on the left side of the screen, as you can see.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.150
Text creation is also located here.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:30.150
Down here, just below this vector creation section, there are some manual relief editing tools, which we will

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.410
discuss in a future session.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.630
At the top, there are some other tools here for creating reliefs.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.440
This one here is the shape editor.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.250
Other commonly used ones are also here.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.140
3D combination and various other tools are at the top.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:58.920
There are also some other vector editing tools a bit higher up, and some other tools for editing or correcting

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.300
vectors on the right side.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:08.670
This project tab is the most important tab that we will use throughout the entire course.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.220
Without it, you won't be able to follow all the steps.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.990
If it does not appear for you, go to the WINDOW menu at the top, then to TOOLBARS AND DOCKING WINDOWS, and

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.450
click on the PROJECT tab at the bottom.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.850
Then, it will appear on your workspace.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.420
Well, another thing we will use a lot are the 3D view modes, okay?

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.620
We will also use the 2D mode, especially when talking about bitmaps.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:44.660
And we will use the menu up here, when opening a file, importing a relief, that kind of thing.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.960
Well, I ask that you get well-acquainted with the environment and become familiar with most of the tools,

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.080
especially for vector creation, as we will be using them a lot.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:04.300
And if you want to change the software layout, just go up to the menu in the WINDOW, in the LAYOUT tab, and

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.840
you will see that there are three options for you to choose there.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.670
What we are using is the standard mode, but there is also the advanced and classic mode for you to choose

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.990
from.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.410
The classic one looks a bit more like the old Artcam or Aspire.

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:28.500
So, if you already have some knowledge or skill with this layout, I recommend that you use the classic one.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.400
This lesson was just the introduction.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:38.750
I look forward to seeing you, in the next lesson where we will start the relief creation process.
